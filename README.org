* Martin's Emacs customization

This is my Emacs customization using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]. I used [[http://aquamacs.org][Aquamacs]] in the past as
a basic setup but found it too cumbersome to customize it back to the pure
Emacs' behaviour.

I found some inspiration in [[http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs][Mike's blog]], [[https://gitlab.com/buildfunthings/emacs-config/blob/master/loader.org][Arjen's work]] and [[https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/emacs.org][Howard's]] repo, but
created mostly my own way.  Things will certainly change with time, e.g. I have
not done a lot of LaTeX recently, which could certainly change.

I basically use Emacs for playing around with Common Lisp using [[https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][Slime]].
