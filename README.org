* Martins Emacs customization

This is my Emacs customization using [[http://aquamacs.org][Aquamacs]][fn:aquamacs] as a basic setup.  I
found some inspiration in [[http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs][Mike's blog]] and [[https://gitlab.com/buildfunthings/emacs-config/blob/master/loader.org][Arjen's work]] but created mostly my
own way.  Things will certainly change with time, e.g. I have not done a lot of
LaTeX recently and am not using flyspell, which could certainly change.

I basically use Emacs for playing around with Common Lisp using [[https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][Slime]].
